                I'm a first-year Computer Science major at Georgia Tech. In middle school, I came across a Khan Academy video on how to code, and I was hooked. I've been coding ever since. In high school, I helped provide coding classes for high schoolers and middle schoolers, organizing fundraisers to raise money for Raspberry Pis. That's what I'm most passionate about, making sure everyone has access to tech and programming! In my free time, I enjoy writing, swimming, and learning some of the endless new technologies that exist (anything but Arch Linux).
